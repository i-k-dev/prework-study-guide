# prework-study-guide
A study guide for course pre-work.

# <EDX Bootcamp Prework Done!>

## Description


I've finally learnt the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript! Though JavaScript is a bit confusing especially the **for** loop - need more practice. Also understood how CLI works and the terms used when typing it all e.g. git add -A. I had an issue with 'git pull origin main' during the Javascript task where it says I have 'divergent branches', but now it seems fine. I dunno what happened there. Now to learn more and develop my skills! :-)
